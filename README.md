# Letter from Birmingham Jail
_By Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr._

This project my own small contribution to Black Lives Matter and an effort to further my own education and growth. I wanted to be able to read this letter, but couldn't find a good version available online that wasn't buried in a PDF. I hope others will find it read it as well.

## Live URL

The latest version of this code is automatically deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is findable at https://letterfromjail.com


## Setup

This text site is set up using the [static site generator Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). If you want to use the build process, run the command `npm install`, and that should install the bits that you need (presuming you have Node and NPM installed already)

To run the build process and serve the site locally, use this combination of commends to build the Sass files and build/serve the site: `gulp & npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`

## Just the site

If you want to just look at or work with the pre-built site, take a peek in the `_site` directory.
