  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

  <p>This project my own small contribution to Black Lives Matter and in response to the murder of George Floyd—and an effort to further my own education and growth. I wanted to read Dr. King’s letter, but couldn't find it represented well online (other than in PDF form). So I made this site.</p>
  <p>Should you be so moved, you can find places to <a href="https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/nbfn-directory">donate to bail funds</a>, learn more about <a href="https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/">the Black Visions Collective</a>, or search through Florida Elago’s <a href="https://www.notion.so/BLACK-LIVES-MATTER-68fe71a3e6974eaa9629af047a074384">extensive database</a> for ways you can help and/or contribute.</p>
  <p>The full source of this project is <a href="https://github.com/jpamental/letter-from-birmingham-jail">publically available on GitHub</a>. Please feel free to contribute, or contact me with suggestions or comments.</p>
