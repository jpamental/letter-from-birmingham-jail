  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

  <p>This project is my own small contribution to Black Lives Matter in response to the murder of George Floyd—and an effort to further my own education and growth. I wanted to read Dr. King’s letter, but couldn’t find it represented well online (other than in PDF form). So I made this site.</p>
  <p><strong>Update:</strong> [posted on 29 March, 2021] After receiving a thoughtful note from a history professor pointing out that the text I had originally posted was abridged, I compared a few other versions and found a more complete text <a href="https://billofrightsinstitute.org/e-lessons/letter-from-birmingham-jail">available on the Bill of Rights Institute website</a> (among a few other sources) and updated it here as well. And as the professor pointed out—it’s worth it for the last paragraph alone. It is a stunningly moving passage.</p>
  <h2>Getting involved</h2>
  <p>Should you be so moved, you can find places to <a href="https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/nbfn-directory">donate to bail funds</a>, learn more about <a href="https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/">the Black Visions Collective</a>, or search through Florida Elago’s <a href="https://www.notion.so/BLACK-LIVES-MATTER-68fe71a3e6974eaa9629af047a074384">extensive database</a> for ways you can help and/or contribute. I’ve added lots more below. To learn more about Dr. King, <a href="https://thekingcenter.org/">visit The King Center</a>.</p>
  <h2>Education &amp; Engagement</h2>
  <p>Since I’m a middle-aged white male, I know there is a lot I don’t know, and a lot I simply don’t experience. These are some of the people and resources that are helping me learn:</p>
<ul>

  <p>Aside from donating directly to the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd">George Floyd Memorial Fund</a> or <a href="https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/">MN Freedom Fund</a>, there are a number of companies offering to match donations to organizations that are doing really good work.
