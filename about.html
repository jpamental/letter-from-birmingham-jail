  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

  <p>This project my own small contribution to Black Lives Matter and in response to the murder of George Floyd—and an effort to further my own education and growth. I wanted to read Dr. King’s letter, but couldn’t find it represented well online (other than in PDF form). So I made this site.</p>
  <h2>Getting involved</h2>
  <p>Should you be so moved, you can find places to <a href="https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/nbfn-directory">donate to bail funds</a>, learn more about <a href="https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/">the Black Visions Collective</a>, or search through Florida Elago’s <a href="https://www.notion.so/BLACK-LIVES-MATTER-68fe71a3e6974eaa9629af047a074384">extensive database</a> for ways you can help and/or contribute. I’ve added lots more below. To learn more about Dr. King, <a href="https://thekingcenter.org/">visit The King Center</a>.</p>
  <h2>Education &amp; Engagement</h2>
  <p>Since I’m a middle-aged white male, I know there is a lot I don’t know, and a lot I simply don’t experience. These are some of the people and resources that are helping me learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/">Black Lives Matter</a> has <a href="https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/">a tremendous action-focused resource page</a> that’s well worth exploring</li>
  <li><a href="https://amelie.is/">Amélie Lamont</a> wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/amelielamont/status/1267826673325535233">a really thoughtful critique</a> of <a href="https://www.aiga.org/statement-pledge-and-call-to-action">AIGA Design’s suggestion that violent, racist policing in the United States could be “redesigned”</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://nicolezhu.io/">Nicole Zhu</a> has compiled <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/racism-101">a list of books for “learning about the history and legacy of slavery and anti-blackness in America”</a>.
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://tatianamac.com/">Tatiana Mac</a> has written guides for <a href="https://tatianamac.com/posts/white-guyde/">white men</a> and <a href="https://tatianamac.com/posts/save-the-tears/">white women</a> looking to understand their own impact and help make real change</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/SamKap/">Sameera Kapila</a> wrote an amazing Twitter thread full of <a href="https://twitter.com/SamKap/status/1267160838911201281">resources for designers looking to understand and decode the largely White/Western biases at the core of the design industry</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://zybryant.com/">Zyahna Bryant</a> wrote an article filled with suggestions on <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/beyond-the-hashtag-how-to-take-anti-racist-action">how to educate yourself in this moment, and how to take action</a></li>
</ul>
  <h2>Donating</h2>
  <p>Aside from donating directly to the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd">George Floyd Memorial Fund</a> or <a href="https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/">MN Freedom Fund</a>, there are a number of companies offering to match donations to organizations that are doing really good work. Here are links to a few:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/nbfn-directory">Community Justice Exchange’s bail fund directory</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.joincampaignzero.org/">Campaign Zero</a> (a non-profit dedicated to ending police violence in America)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/donation-matching">Web hosting company Netlify’s donation matching page</a> is a great resource (which is where this site is hosted)</li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/7alexbruno/status/1268198594802319361">Alex Bruno’s got a list of donation matching opportunities</a>
